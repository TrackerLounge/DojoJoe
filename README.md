# Dojo Joe
Tai Chi Chin Na Training Dummy

# Introduction
By way of background, I am a hobbiest. I initially learned four versions of Tai Chi forms(13-form style, two forms of Wu Style, and one Yang Style), right-handed and left-handed, from books, as a form of light excersise. I was interested in exploring the application and meaning of the forms. I have no live experience. I live in a remote area, where sparring partners are rare.

I eventually found a book called Tai Chi Chin Na - The Seizing Art of Tai Chi Chuan by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming PhD, 
[Book on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Tai-Chi-Chin-Na-Seizing-ebook/dp/B06XSN17T5/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Chin+Na+the+seizing+art+of+Tai+chi+chuan+by+Dr.+Yang&qid=1590606941&sr=8-1)
ISBN-13 : 978-1-59439-307-5, ISBN-10: 1-59439-307-9 which outlines some of the joint lock applications found the Tai Chi Yang Style Form.
I have no affiliation with Dr. Yang. I have enjoyed his book and would recommend it.

I wanted to practice these applications, as time allowed, early in the morning, before work, or late at night, after work. 

The goal of this project was to create a sparring training dummy to practice joint locks on and memorize/explore the techineques. 
This was not intended to replace live sparring practice. I explored the movements in the Tai Chi forms to "discover"/understand their mechanics and applications. This helped me appreciate the meaning of the forms more fully and informed how I did the forms.

This sparring dummy allows me to practice route movements over and over again, with force, at any time of day or night, when a living sparring partner is not available. I was safely able to repeatedly practice the bending, twisting and jerking forces (think shearing and tearing) on Dojo Joe without fear of inflicting injury. It also allows me to experiment with variations in the movements, and chaining movements together, and experimenting with transitions. I broke the dummys joints in many ways. It is not uncommon for an arm or leg to be torn free. This also helped me to safely understand the forces involved and applications better. Over time I modified the dummy to break in ways that are fast and easy to repair. All joints are secured as knots that gradually loosen over time under force. To fix a broken joint, I simple retie the knots.

Over the course of several years, I practiced with this sparring dummy (which I call Dojo Joe) for 30-60 minutes a day. My typical routine was to perform each technique in the book 30 times right handed and then left handed. I memorized the book for a time and became comfortable with the movements. The movements became instinctual. However, this type of training is without a resistant opponent (e.g. no pressure testing). As such, I considered myself a novice. Since that time, I moved and had much less time to train. 

Many martial arts have similar joint locks and may find some use for this training tool. In this page, I'll describe the dummy, it's construction and use. I hope someone will find it fun and useful. 

Note of warning: Be sure that your lines and anchors are firmly attached. Failure to achor the lag screw firmly into a ceiling joist could result in serious injury. Proceed at your own risk.

# Price
Dojo Joe cost ~$100 to make
The elastic shock cord was the most expensive portion of this build. I bought it by the foot from a hardware store.

# Tools
* hack saw
* measuring tape
* coordless drill and 5/16 in. drill bit and 1/2 in. drill bit (I think) to predrill lag screw ceiling hook
* scissors
* electrical tape to hold elastic cord while fusing
* ligher to fuse the ends of ropes to prevent fraying
* magic markert to mark parts
* vice or clamp to hold parts while sawing (if available) - I did no have a vise or clamp. I ended up using my kitchen table (spreading the leaves apart and smashing my part betwee the leaves).
* metal file or sandpaper to debur/sand ends of pvc
* flathead screw driver to ream out dill hole burs and force elastic thru drilled holes.


# Construction Materials
* 3.5 in. long 1/2 in. thick lag screw hook to attach to ceiling. The threaded shank should be 3.5 in. in length or greater. Assume that the first 0.5 in. of threading will be in non-load bearing dry wall. For safety, you want as much threaded screw (3 in. or more) in the joist as possible.
* 1/4 in. metal pully.
* 3/4 in. and 1/2 in. PVC Pipe for bones
* 1/4 in. PVC for the core of the head to allow rope to pass thru
* 1/4 in. polypropylene braided rope for part of the line supporting Dojo Joe from the ceiling. This part passes thru the pully
* 3/8 in. elastic shock cord running from pelvic bone, thru spine, shoulders, neck and head.
* 1/4 in. elastic cord for joints and part of line to support the sparring partner from the ceiling to a movable weight on the ground. 
  * Note: I originally used 100 lb zip ties to attach the joints. However, I found that I would break (sheer or tear) the zip tie joint after 1 to 10 iterations practicing a joint lock. 
* High strength deaminum magnets (to allow fingers to grasp my wrist). Each magnet is about the diameter of a penny and about 2-3 penny's thick or 3/4 in. by 1/8 in.
* epoxy to attach magnets to end of fingers
* para-cord to create fingers.
* 1 in. metal nut (one for each hand). I use the metal nut as a spacer between the magnets when I want to practice upper arm grabs and counters. I don't use the nut when I want the dummy's grip to be smaller (e.g. when grasping my wrist)
* Peanut Butter Plastic container for the head
* Spray foam to fill head and allow it to take a beating. (I had some extra outdoor spray foam from a previous project). You can leave it empty but it tends to be crushed fairly quickly (e.g in head locks, neck and spine locks, and head strikes while applying leverage on an arm lock).
* Shirt and pants to prevent pvc joints from pinching/scratching/cutting me. This can be quite painful. Also helps dummy move correctly
* 2 Denim bags. I place one bag on each foot and insert a 5 pound weight in each bag to keep Dojo Joe's feet from flying about. Each bag has a paracord draw string and toggle cord stopper. The drawstring allows me to quickly attach the weighted bags to the dummy's feet during setup.
* Free Anchor weight to attach the end of the line to the ground. Hopefully, the weight will slide on the ground before the ceiling bolt fails.
* Each foot has two pipes making up the foot. Each foot pipe has a 2 in. carage bolt, washer and nut passing thru the sole of the foot to the top of the foot to create a small threading knob on the top of the foot. The tibea and fibea bones rest on these bolt thread Knobs to keep them roughly in place around the anckle.

# Size / Scale
I tried to replicate my own bone structure. I measured my arm to get the length of the PVC pipes to create the ulna and radius and repeated the process for each major bone of the body. I did not create every bone of the body. For example, I did not create ribs. I only have two fingers and a thumb. These simplifications reduced cost and time of construction. The dummy is simple enough that these could be added at a later date as needed.

# Contruction process
This was a trial and error process. I wanted joints that naturally wanted to be in a normal human posture and would spring back to that posture when no force was being applied. I also wanted to create joints that resisted moving in unnature motions. This required experimenting with how to rig elastic and rope within the bone structure. In some cases I had to redrill holes in new places to get the joints to flex and bend more naturally. Most of the techniques I was learning focused on the fingers, wrists, elbows and shoulders. As a result, this dummy has better joint behavior in these areas. 

It was also very important that I be able to bring the dummy to the ground and have it return to standing position on it's own (or reset) automatically after I released it. It took some trial and error to figure out the right amount of static and elastic line to use to suspend the dummy from the ceiling to accomplish this goal.

This was originally built while living in an apartment with 8 foot high ceilings. I used common hand tools and my kitchen table as a vise. This lead to crude and slow construction. The line length had to be modified to fit a higher ceiling in my new place.

# Elastic and Static Rigging of Bone Structure
I used black parachute cord to hold joints together loosely. There were added to keep the limb in place when or if the joint failed.
The black parachute cord was also used as moving anchor points, for static and elastic line to pull against.

I used 1/4 in. polypropylene braided rope within the chest area. The color helped be differentiate pulling forces as I worked out how to rig the elastic and static lines holding the PVC pipe bones together. It is a bit of a squirrel's nest of lines, evolving thru trial and error. More improvements could be done.

The rigging within the chest tries to mirror the behavior of the trapezius muscles of the back. We want rigidity in some directions and flexibility in others. I found that in most cases for the Chin Na movements, it was helpful if Dojo Joe resisted having the arm raised above the head and resisted having the arm turned out to the side. I found that it worked well if I had elasitc pulling towards the midway point halfway along the length of the spine. I found that the anchor point needed to move around a little bit to feel more natural. It was preferable to have Dojo Joe want to pull its elbows tighly to its sides. This was an process of experimentation. It isn't perfect and I may revisit again but for now it is "good enough". You may need to experiment to figure out what makes sense for your training needs. 

It may also be possible to simplify this arangement greatly. I evolved to this point. You may be able to drill holes mid-spine and anchor the elastic shock cord directly to that point and avoid some of the "squirrel's nest" of rigging. You'll have to experiment and see. You will see in the pictures that I have lots of "excess". Typically, I was too lazy to undo everything and remove the excess. Or I wasn't sure if a configuration would work and wanted to try it without cutting the excess. In these cases, I tied the excess around a bone to "keep it out of the way".

Be aware that the static line does serve a purpose. Static lines hold the shoulders and pelvis relatively in line with each other. The shirt rests against the static line and makes a surface like a sail. This creates a feeling of volume to Dojo Joe, that would be lost if the static lines were removed. By keeping the shirt spread out, the shirt is also prevented from bunching up, twisting on the dummy or tangling up your arms as you move thru a form. 

I used a 5/16 in. drill bit to create holes in the pvc pipes. The orientation of these holes can effect posture of the dummy at rest. A hole should be drilled in line with the force of direction. otherwise, when the elastic line is attached and exerting tension, a misaligned hole will cause the pvc pipe "bone" to roll/turn until the hole is in alignment with the direcion of tension. A bad hole alignment may result in the arm turning in towards the body more than you want or turning out away from the body more than you want.

Note: I used some white braided cord on the shoulders to create a loop to hang dojo joe by in the closet on two coat hangers when not in use.

The fingers have deaminum magnets epoxyied onto the fingertips to allow Dojo Joe to grasp my wrist or arm in a breakable grip. In the hand, the paracord is used to retain a metal nut. This nut is a spacer to adjust the grasp of the fingers. The paracord allows the nut to hang out of the way when not needed.

An elatic line runs from each upper arm (hole was placed 1/3 of the way down the humerus, from the shoulder) thru the pelvic bone and attach to the knee joint. The pelvic bone floats freely on the elastic line.

The pelvis is attached to the femur with paracord at present. I haven't needed very realistic hip joints so these are very simple. At times I wanted more complexity here but haven't taken the time to implement them. I think I might need a more 3D rib-cage to get the joint to function correctly.

In the image, the knees are not built the same. I've broken the knee joints many times and was not always careful in my reconstruction of the knee. Sometimes I have the femur in front, and sometimes I have it in back of the knee cap. I prefer it to be in front of the knee cap like it is on the right leg (left side of the image).

The tibia and fibula pvc pipes rest on the foot pvc pipes about a 1/4 of the length of the foot from the back. I have shock cord attached to the tibia and fibula that run down towards the front and back of the foot. This allows me to practice ankle joint locks.
However, I found that the tibia and fibula slipped along the foot pvc pipes too easily and did not retain a natural posture. 
To prevent the tibia and fibula from sliding around, I drilled holes in the feet and pasted two 2 in. cariage bolts from the bottom up and secured them with a washer and nut. This gave the tibia and fibula something to sit on and prevent them from sliding around on the foot. It isn't perfect but seems to work "good enough" most of the time. You can see one of the bolts exposed in the top view picture.

I found that the Dojo Joe worked better if its feet were weighted. This counteracts the upward springy pull from the ceiling. This keeps the dummy in place and makes body mechanics feel more natural. Originally I used paracord to connect a 2 lb and 3 lb weight (for a total of 5 lbs per foot) to each foot. I found this annoying and ended up sewing some bags out of an old pair of jeans to place the weights and foot in. Each bag has a draw string to make attachment fast and easy. This isn't perfect but it worked much better. When practicing kick traps, knee and ankle locks, I remove the bag from the kicking leg. This is a little annoying and at times I would skip those techniques because of this minor annoyance of taking off the bag and putting it back on a few minutes later. Not good. Perhaps in future, I will cast some lead soles for the feet and bolt them in place, with quick-release cotter pins.

Once attached, I can move the foot around easily to set up different scenerios. The feet do move as I perform joint locks and take Dojo Joe to the ground. Depending on the joint-lock, I may need to reset the feet after each iteration.

# Ceiling Mounting
I orignially built this for a small 8 x 8 ft apartment space with 8 ft. high ceilings. When I moved to a place with higher ceilings, I added an extension of rope to allow the pulley to hang in about the same spot that it would have hung from when I had 8 ft ceilings. This seems to work fine.

Ideally the ceiling mount would be placed 4 ft from any wall as the dummy's arms can fly out wide while performing certain joint locks and hit walls or you. However, I have mounted it closer to the wall at times (e.g. 2.5 feet away from the wall). This works but is less than ideal. It can make it hard to practice moving behind the dummy and can make noise or damage the wall if a pvc arm hits the wall. 

Be sure that your ceiling joists and your hardware (lag screw hook and pulley) are substantial enough to bear the forces you will be exerting. Make sure that your lag screew hook is long enough. Assume that 1/2 in. of the lagscrew will be in flimsy dry wall. You want a minimum of 3 in. of screw embedded in a joist. More is better. I predrilled a hole (diameter of inner diameter of the lag screw, not including the threading - I think I used a 1/2 in. drill bit) before hand screwing the lag screw hook into the ceiling.

I had to play around with the proportion of static line to elastic line in the overall length of line suspending Dojo Joe from the ceiling. Too much elastic line would make Dojo Joe too compliant and would result in it not standing back up after being taken down to the ground. Too much static line would make Dojo Joe too resistant and would prevent Dojo Joe from being able to be taken to the ground in a joint lock.

I don't love having a ground anchor. I have thought to run the line from the pulley to a wall hook to act as the anchor. However, I do like that the ground anchor will move under load first before the ceiling lag screw would fail. It feels a little safer. This does mean that periodically I have to reset the achor weight as it has a tendency to slid towards Dojo Joe and loosen the tension on the suspension line over time. The anchor line is a little more in the way at times. Most of the time these are trivial annoyances.

Note: The head is free-floating on the neck. There is a 1/2 in. pvc core in the head to protect the foam in the head from the line.

# Noise
The pulley can make a squeeking noise. A little oil can reduce the noise. The rope, running thru the pulley can also make noise. Jodo Joe's bones are hollow and can create a clattering sound as they strike together. This noise could be reduced by filling each pipe with foam (but it seems like a mess and a hassel). If you are living in an apartment complex, the neighbors may hear this and ask you to avoid practice during sleeping hours.

# Dojo Joe
Tai Chi Chin Na Training Dummy

# Introduction
By way of background, I am hobbiest. I initially learned a number of Tai Chi forms(two forms of Wu Style, and one Yang Style) from books, as a form of light excersise. I was interested in exploring the application and meaning of the forms. I have no live experience. I live in a remote area, where sparring partners are rare.

I eventually found a book called Tai Chi Chin Na - The Seizing Art of Tai Chie Chuan by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming PhD, ISBN-13 : 978-1-59439-307-5, ISBN-10: 1-59439-307-9 which outlines some of the joint lock applications found the Tai Chi Yang Style Form.

I wanted practice these applications as time allowed early in the morning before work or late at night after work. 

The goal of this project was to create a sparring training dummy to practice joint locks on and memorize/explore the techineques. 
This was not intended to replace live sparring practice. I also explored the movements in the Wu Style forms to "discover"/understand their mechanics and applications. This helped me appreciate the meaning of the forms more fully and informed how I did the forms.

This sparring dummy allows me to practice route movements over and over again, with force, at any time of day or night, when a living sparring partner is not available. It also allows me to experiment with variations in the movements, and chaining movements together, and experimenting with transitions. I broke the dummys joints in many ways. It is not uncommon for an arm or leg to be torn free. This also helped me to safely understand the forces involved and applications better. Over time I modified the dummy to break in ways that are fast and easy to repair. All joints are secured as knots that gradually loosen over time under force. To fix a broken joint, I simple retie the knots together again.

Over the course of several years, I practiced with this sparring dummy (which I call Dojo Joe) for 30-60 minutes a day. My typical routine was to perform each technique in the book 30 times right handed and then left handed. I memorized the book for a time and became comfortable with the movements. The movements became instinctual. However, this type of training is without pressure testing. As such I considered myself a novice.

Many martial arts have similar joint locks and may find some use for this training tool. In this page, I'll describe the dummy, it's construction and use. I hope someone will find it fun and useful. 

Note of warning: Be sure that your lines and anchors are firmly attached. Failure to achor the lag screw firmly into a ceiling joist could result in serious injury. Proceed at your own risk.

# Price
Dojo Joe cost ~$100 to make

# Tools
* hack saw
* measuring tape
* coordless drill and drill bits 
* scissors
* electrical tape to hold elastic cord while fusing
* ligher to fuse the ends of ropes to prevent fraying
* magic markert to mark parts
* vice or clamp to hold parts while sawing (if available)

# Construction Materials
* 3 in. long 1/2 in. thick lag screw hook to attach to ceiling.
* 1/4 in. metal pully.
* 2 in. PVC Pipe for bones
* 1/4 in. PVC for the core of the head to allow rope to pass thru
* 1/4 in plyeurithan rope for part of the line supporting Dojo Joe from the ceiling. This part passes thru the pully
* 1/4 in. elastic cord for joints and part of line to support the sparring partner from the ceiling. 
  * Note: I originally used 100 lb zip ties to attach the joints. However, I found that I would break a joint after 1 to 10 iterations of a joint lock. 
* High strength magnets (to allow fingers to grasp my wrist)
* epoxy to attach magnets to end of fingers
* para-cord to create fingers.
* 1 in. metal nut (one for each hand). I use the metal nut as a spacer between the magnets when I want to practice upper arm grabs and counters. I don't use the nut when I want the dummy's grip to be smaller (e.g. when grasping my wrist)
* Peanut Butter Plastic container for the head
* Spray foam to fill head and allow it to take a beating. (I had some extra outdoor spray foam from a previous project). You can leave it empty but it tends to be crushed fairly quickly (e.g in head locks, neck and spine locks, and head strikes while applying leverage on an arm lock).
* Shirt and pants to prevent pvc joints from pinching/scratching/cutting me. This can be quite painful.
* 2 Denim bags. I place one bag on each foot and insert a 5 pound weight in each bag to keep Dojo Joe's feet from flying about.
* Free Anchor weight to attach the end of the line to the ground. Hopefully, the weight will slide on the ground before the ceiling bolt fails.

# Size / Scale
I tried to replicate my own bone structure. I measured my arm to get the length of the PVC pipes to create the ulna and radius and repeated the process for each major bone of the body. I did not create every bone of the body. For example, I did not create ribs. I only have two fingers and a thumb. These simplifications reduced cost and time of construction. The dummy is simple enough that these could be added at a later date as needed.

# Contruction process
This was a trial and error process. I wanted joints that naturally wanted to be in a normal human posture and would spring back to that posture when no force was being applied. I also wanted to create joints that resisted moving in unnature motions. This required experimenting with how to rig elastic and rope within the bone structure. In some cases I had to redrill holes in new places to get the joints to flex and bend more naturally. Most of the techniques I was learning focused on the fingers, wrists, elbows and shoulders. As a result, this dummy has better joint behavior in these areas. 

It was also very important that I be able to bring the dummy to the ground and have it return to standing position on it's own (or reset) automatically after I released it. It took some trial and error to figure out the right amount of static and elastic line to use to suspend the dummy from the ceiling to accomplish this goal.

This was originally built while living in an apartment with 8 foot high ceilings. I used common hand tools and my kitchen table as a vise. This lead to crude and slow construction. The line length had to be modified to fit a higher ceiling in my new place.

# Ceiling Mounting
I orignially built this for a small 8 x 8 ft apartment space. Ideally the ceiling mount would be placed 4 ft from any wall as the dummy's arms can fly out wide while performing certain joint locks and hit walls or you. However, I have mounted it closer to the wall at times (e.g. 2.5 feet away from the wall). This works but is less than ideal. It can make it hard to practice moving behind the dummy and can make noise or damage the wall if a pvc arm hits the wall.

# Noise
The pulley can make a squeeking noise. A little oil can reduce the noise. The rope, running thru the pulley can also make noise. If you are living in an apartment complex, the neighbors may hear this and ask you to avoid practice during sleeping hours.

Tai Chi Chin Na Training Dummy

# Introduction
By way of background, I am hobbiest. I initially learned a number of Tai Chi forms(two forms of Wu Style, and one Yang Style) from books as a form of light excersise. I was interested in exploring the application and meaning of the forms. I have no live experience. I live in a remote area, where sparing partners are rare.

I eventually found a book called Tai Chi Chin Na by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming PhD, ISBN-13 : 978-1-59439-307-5, ISBN-10: 1-59439-307-9 which outlines some of the joint lock applications found the Tai Chi Yang Style Form.

I wanted practice these applications as time allowed early in the morning before work or late at night after work. 

The goal of this project was to create a sparing training dummy to practice joint locks on and memorize/explore the techineques. 
This was not intended to replace live sparing practice. I also explored the movements in the Wu Style forms to "discover"/understand their mechanics and applications. This helped me appreciate the meaning of the forms more fully and informed how I did the forms.

This sparing dummy allows me to practice route movements over and over again, with force, at any time of day or night, when a sparing partner is not available. It also allows me to experiment with variations in the movements, and chaining movements together, experimenting with transitions. I broke the dummys joints in many ways. This also helped me to safely understand the forces involved and applications better.

Over the course of several years, I practiced with this sparing dummy (which I call Dojo Joe) for 30-60 minutes a day. My typical routine was to perform each technique in the book 30 times right handed and then left handed. I memorized the book for a time and became comfortable with the movements. The movements became instinctual. However, this type of training is without pressure testing. As such I considered myself a novice.

Many martial arts have similar joint locks and may find some use for this training tool. In this page, I'll describe the dummy, it's construction and use. I hope someone will find it fun and useful.
